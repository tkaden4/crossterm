//! In this module I make use of the command pattern to wrap state changes.
//!
//! The `command pattern` is an OOP concept but what it does is very handy.
//! Shortly said what this pattern can do is having an command (struct) like `EnableRawModeCommand` this command has two methods one to `execute` that command and one to `undo`.
//! Every time you preform some action you can push it into an list and at the end when you want to revert all the commands you have executed than you can loop true that loop true that list and `undo` the actions.
//!
//! So where do whe use the `Commands` for? This is so that we can push all or terminal state changes into list.
//! When we do not need those changes we can revert all the changes by looping true the list and undo all the action.
//!
//! See the `Context` struct where we store the commands for more info.
